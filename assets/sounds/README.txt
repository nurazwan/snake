SOUNDS FOLDER
=============

Put your sound files here:

- eat.wav      - Sound when snake eats food (short beep or munch sound)
- gameover.wav - Sound when game ends (sad trombone or crash sound)
- bgm.ogg      - Background music (optional, loops forever)

The game works fine without sounds - this is optional!
